### Project Proposals

Group: 
    David

Goal: 
    To create a variational autoencoder that can generate new fonts based off of pre-existing sample fonts

How I'll do it: 
    Download at least 100 font sample images from a font site like dafont.com
    Create a autoencoder utilizing several convolutional layers to properly encode and decode the fonts
    Research variational networks more
    Introduce variational properties into the autoencoder
    
Halfway there:
    A fully functional autoencoder (non-variational)
