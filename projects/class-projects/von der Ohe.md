Group: Spencer von der Ohe
Goal: To create an AI for my game Cut Off(Similar to Tron) that is able to beat an average human player(not me, I have tested it too much) 1/4 of the time of greater
How will it be done: I plan to start out by tring to create some sort of reinforcement learning or Monte Carlo search and train it against my expert system AI that I have already made and see how the AI fairs against people
Half way there goal: Create an AI that can consistanly beat my expert system AI
