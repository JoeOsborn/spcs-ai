    "GOAL: Trying to predicting scoring of student-given short answers\n",
    "\n",
    "MOTIVATION: At least at a basic level, the scoring of short answers is a repetitive task, especially if one groups training data right. Exams such as the TOEFL are best suited for such a task since the answers are clearly predictable, but only humans rank the answers. Combining an automated scoring AI system with speech recognition would have a great impact on speaking scoring tasks in language evaluations exams.\n",
