The goal of the proejct is to use machine learning to find the rules of a cellular automaton and consequentially be able to run the simulation of the cellular automaton.

The data will be many iterations of running the cellular automaton for the program to learn from it.
I will probably use one of the neural network strategies, I'm not sure which yeat but that's why we're investigating them now and taking tutorials.

"Halfway there" would be something like getting basic rules such as those in the game of life, or be able to run the simulations fairly well but with some mishaps on different steps.
