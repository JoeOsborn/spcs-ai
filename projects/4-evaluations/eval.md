# Preliminary Evaluation

Hello, and thanks for your interest in the class! I've been really impressed with everyone's level of engagement and pace with the material, and I wanted to get a sense of how everyone is feeling about the course at the end of the first week. Here are a few short questions. Please fill the multiple-choice questions out by replacing the placeholder `(_)` with your choice (among A, B, etc), and put your answers to the free-form questions on the subsequent line. When you're done, email this to a TA and they'll compile them together, anonymize them, and send them to me.
