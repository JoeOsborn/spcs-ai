# Preliminary Evaluation

Hello, and thanks for your interest in the class! I've been really impressed with everyone's level of engagement and pace with the material, and I wanted to get a sense of how everyone is feeling about the course at the end of the first week. Here are a few short questions. Please fill the multiple-choice questions out by replacing the placeholder `(_)` with your choice (among A, B, etc), and put your answers to the free-form questions on the subsequent line. When you're done, email this to a TA and they'll compile them together, anonymize them, and send them to me.

The amount of reading is (B)

A.  not enough
B.  about right
C.  too much

I’d prefer the lectures to (B)

A.  go slower
B.  remain the same
C.  go faster

The assignments so far (B/C) #I do not think the assigments themselfs are too hard but it is taking a while to get a hang of python(quite different from more fimilar languages like java and C#) so it is taking longer than expected

A.  are too short—we need more to do.
B.  are just right.
C.  are too long/difficult—we need more time/help to complete them.

I’d find it useful to have (B)

A.  more discussion in general
B.  the same amount of discussion
C.  less discussion in general

I’d find it useful if we discussed specific readings for (B)

A.  more time
B.  about the same amount of time
C.  less time

Are there any topics you would like to see covered in the course that are not already on the syllabus?

(Posibily more effectint techniques of storing data from machine learning, maybe using some sort of Data mining to find a patern that the machine could follow instead of keeping a tree of thousands or millions of nodes)

Are there any topics that we’ve covered in class that you would have liked to have spent more time on?

(Not so far)
