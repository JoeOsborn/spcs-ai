# Shakey

## Overview
Developed at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in 1969, Shakey the robot was one of the first robots that had the ability to carry out commands without having to be told the individual, basic chunks. According to the Computer History Museum, Shakey "capitalized on progress in computer vision, language processing, and planning to understand instructions ... and direct its own actions."

## Perspective
Researchers at Stanford created Shakey at a time when the field of Artificial Intelligence was barely getting started, and they simply worked on it with the for AI research purposes. Since this robot was purely for research, mass-market goals need not be considered.
