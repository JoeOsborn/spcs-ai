    "Hi, My name is Medha Chappidi and I am a rising senior in Klein Oak Highschool which is located in a suburb of Houston, TX known as Spring. After a two years of AP CS I was in CS SL in the IB program where we got to build a database for a project and also our own websites (which is where I first used github). After this I got to attend an all girls computer science camp at the University of Texas called First Bytes where I was first introduced to AI. I got to see the robots the robocup team used and they showed us a bit of what they were working on. This led to my growing interest in AI, and I started reading about Twitter Bots and wanted to make one myself. I also wanted to write my EE which is an extended essay ( a year long research paper that is mandatory for IB) on a specific AI topic, and I really hope this course can help me specify what topic to do this and I can hopefully find out a more specific branch of AI I am interested in. Programming and generally anything coding relating has always come across as daunting to me and I just want more experience and knowledge in this area. Outside of anything computer related I love learning to juggle, biking, and rock climbing. I'm also working on starting a non profit with my friend to provide education to children  in Mexico and India. "
