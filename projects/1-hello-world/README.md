Individual (short) assignment.

Submit an IPython notebook with a Markdown cell briefly introducing yourself: your background in programming and/or AI, what you hope to gain from this course, and your favorite hobby or hobbies outside of programming (and even outside of computing).

Also include a Python cell which prints out your name using the `print()` function, or does some other thing you find interesting or entertaining.

Put your notebooks here: `lastname.ipynb`.
