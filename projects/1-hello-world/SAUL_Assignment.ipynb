    "# Hello Joe! I'm Erel Saul and I'm from Turkey, Istanbul. \n",

    "I have always been interested in technology and computers but the first time I had the chance to pursue this interest was in 8th grade when I took 'Introduction to CS' course in 'Istanbul C Programmers Foundation'. With that course, I learned the basics of programming and a little bit of Java (the course was taught in Java language). Later, in 9th grade, I felt that I shouldn't rush into creating apps and all that stuff but I should keep masterminding the fundementals of CS and have a solid backbone. So this time I took an online course from Udacity. It was taught in Python and I was required to submit a project to pass the course. I built a very basic social network which helped me learn databases, functions, syntaxes in further depth. This year I took elective CS lesson in my school and studied databases via Microsoft Access. Also I participated in the first ever coding competition for high school students in Turkey. \n",
    "\n",
    "By taking this course I hope to expand my CS knowledge and learn from other people's perspectives. My other hobbies include sports (especially basketball and soccer), politics and video games. \n",
