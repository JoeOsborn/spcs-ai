    "Hi, I'm Jackson Deitelzweig. I have a basic background of programming in Python and Java, but mostly Python. I have also been doing some research with natural language processing including sentiment analysis and stance detection, and I have a small familiarity with neural networks. I have mostly worked with classifiers. From this course, I want to enhance my knowledge of aritificial intelligence and learn more about deep learning and other techniques, since those are becoming extremely prominenet in the field. Outside programming, I like to run, rock climb, and play with my dog."
