    - search heuristic that mimics the process of natural selection. 
    - a population of candidate solutions (called individuals, creatures, or phenotypes) to an optimization problem is evolved toward better solutions. 
    - Each candidate solution has a set of properties (its chromosomes or genotype) which can be mutated and altered; traditionally, solutions are represented in binary as strings of 0s and 1s
