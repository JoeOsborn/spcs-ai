Google Translate is an online translation service provided by Google Inc. to translate text, images or even real-time video to over 103 languages. Its algorithm is based on statistical analysis, which skims thousands of documents translated by humans. 

The algorithm was written by German computer scientist Franz Josef Och, born in 1971. He was the chief architect of Google Translate and head of machine translation in the company for a couple of years. From 2002 to 2004 he worked as a Research Scientist at the USC. While he was there he published several papers related to machine translation and natural language processing.

This system has been widely used by people all over the world, since it’s available on many platforms, including Android and iOS smartphones and web browsers. Och wanted to create a system in which users could easily find what a foreign text meant. The system he thought was the best was translation by statistical matching. 

This system is both statistical and knowledge-based. In one hand, the algorithm uses texts translated by real people and analyses them to find similarities. But the power the system has is based on human knowledge that has been previously inputted. 

The interface Google Translate with its users is pretty simple -- a textbox to input what you want to translate, a label for the translated text and two dropdowns for the languages of the text inputted and the language you want your text to be translated to. This interfaces is similar wherever you use the service. 

Google launched Translate Community back in 2015, as an attempt to get the Google Translate user base to improve the service. Volunteers can help by verifying translated phrases and translate phrases in their languages to and from English, helping to improve the service’s accuracy. Some users have tried using this platform to hack the translation database by inputting mistaken translations without success.
