The Google Self-Driving Car (referred to as "Car" in this file) is a project being developed by (Google) X, a division of Alphabet that focuses on AI and technology. Its goal is to increase the ease and safety of road travel by eliminating the human factor as much as possible, which according to the Self-Driving Car Project website is responsible for 94% of car accidents in the US. Though currently still in development, the project is eventually imagined for common use, whether as a personal car or as a taxi system.

The Car uses both map and sensor information to determine its location in the world, as well as its location relative to objects such as other cars, road intersections, etc. From a knowledge representation standpoint, the Car views the world as a collection of paths (roads), with various moving and stationary objects along those paths. Since the goal is to safely deliver the passenger from location to location, important concepts would include pathfinding (similar to GPS technology) and spacial awareness. The Car would also need to incorporate other concepts to be able to safely interact with humans; some include traffic laws, and safe driving.

The Car's system views other humans as primarily moving objects that need to be avoided and which should be given priority of movement, especially in areas such as crosswalks. The human passengers are not expected to interact much with the system besides inputting destinations, but will be given some consideration, mainly for comfort.

Though the Car is designed to be as safe as possible, any successful attempts to subvert/override the system could result in injury to both passengers and other people (pedestrians, bikers, drivers, etc). For example, the Car could be made to drive at reckless speeds and in random directions, causing serious car accidents. Finally, there are possible ethical concerns that could arise, such as with whom the responsibility lies in case of a car accident.
