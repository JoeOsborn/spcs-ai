# Facebook image description software

## overview
As of early April 2016, Facebook decided to roll out its first version of an Artificial Intelligence bringing accurate captions of pictures to the blind und visually impaired, a minority until then excluded from most social networks.

## users and goals
Facebook aims to make its services available to as many people as possible worldwide. This means integrating even the smaller minorities in the social network, like in this case the blind and visually impaired and dealing with the related communication difficulties .

## knowledge based / data samples based
As for most image recognition systems nowadays, this system is trained to learn from large amounts of data samples in order to recognize certain objects such as planes, cats, landscapes, as well as facial expressions. The system's accuracy is dependent on the algorithms used and most importantly, the quality and amount of certified training data it has at hand. For now the system gives good results, but we will certainly see more significant improvements in performance in the next few years.

## interaction with people
In connection with other programs like voiceover on IOS, the Facebook-provided image captions can directly be read out loud to the user, overwinding the visual disability.

## blind spots / ethics
The system still has flaws and can never give 100% accurate results. In previous attempts from other companies such as Twitter or even Google there had been some incidents of black people being tagged as "apes" or even "gorillas". As an attempt to prevent some of these unwanted discriminatory and/or hurtful captions, Facebook is deciding to only provide captions when the system is at least 80% confident about what the image contains and not provide any data if situated under that 80% mark.
