# Self-driving vehicles
##### William Chern

### Overview
**Self-driving systems**, such as the ones being developed by [Tesla](https://www.teslamotors.com/presskit/autopilot) or Google, are meant to (one day) replace human drivers for driving and operating cars. Technology companies and some automakers are currently developing this type of technology with the goal of replacing human drivers entirely and also with the hope of using the self-driving technology as an important marketing point to sell more cars.

### Users & goals
Drivers are obviously the people who would benefit from this technology. From a safety and accuracy perspective, it is in the best interests of both the companies developing this technology and the users for this system to be as safe as possible. However, users are not likely to care about this technology as a selling point for cars, since only the automakers care about their profits.

### Knowledge-based
The self-driving systems are mostly knowledge-based (as opposed to statistical). Most of the rules, such as traffic laws, are programmed by humans.

### Interaction with people
The self-driving systems can be activated by humans with just a few button presses. It assumes that the user is aware of traffic laws and can manually operate the vehicle without assistance from the computer. In the case of Tesla Autopilot, the system also assumes that the user understands that the software is in beta and should not be relied upon solely (though, as recent incidents suggest, many users ignore this warning and decide to fully rely upon Autopilot anyway).

### Blind spots
Since these self-driving systems are generally programmed using training data gathered by test drives, the scope of this data is not likely to cover all possible road conditions everywhere. Thus, there will limitations to the use of this technology, and an error in the system's judgement (e.g. trying to "misfit" the situation into one of the data set's scenarios) could result in casualties or even deaths. It should also be noted that if an error were to be intentionally snuck into the system, it could also injure drivers and passengers.
