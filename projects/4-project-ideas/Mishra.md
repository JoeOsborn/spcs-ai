    For my final project, I would like to individually explore genetic algorithms. My end goal is to create a short presentation/report about different genetic algorithms alongside an implementation of a simple algorithm with a graphical representation to show others how it works. 
    To achieve this objective, I will read diverse sources online to collect information about genetic algorithms. I'll also look at tutorials so I can implement some of the solutions I read about. For my program, I will get my dataset from online resources.
    As I am completing this project, I will give myself benchmarks to make sure I'm staying on track. Here is a rough outline of what I'm planning to do:
    Thursday: Start general research and pinpoint areas of interest
    Friday: Finish all general research and start research on specific areas of interest
    Saturday: Finish all research, find algorithm to implement + associated tutorial
    Sunday: Start writing paper/presentation, start implementing algorithm
    Monday: Finish writing paper/presentation, keep implemeting algorithm
    Tuesday: Finish implementing algorithm, write simple graphical interface to show what it does
    Wednesday: Polish paper/presentation/algorithm/interface
