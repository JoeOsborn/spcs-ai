# Project Idea
Create a (convolutional) neural network to parse images with handwritten content into a textual output.

Outline:
  * Will likely not use a framework (external library) for the network
    * May use a mathematical algebra (matrix) library
  * Will train on a large open-source dataset
  * May need to run on external server
