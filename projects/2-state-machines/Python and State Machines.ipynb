    "State machines, like most transition systems, are defined in terms of their set of states, their initial state, their terminal states, and the valid transitions between the states. State machines are still used widely in game character AI, but they also show up in various guises all over computer science (for example in regular expressions, program verification, cyber-physical systems, ...). A solid understanding of transition systems is key to understanding many different research areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's assignment is to use state machines in a couple of different ways to get used to reading and writing Python code, and to get a feel for what can be done with state machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to create a data type to represent state machines. In Python, the custom data type is the `class`. We know that it will be initialized with a set of states and edges, an initial state, and some terminal states, and creating a state machine should look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ab_a_ = StateMachine(\n",
    "    #We can define the states and edges in one go\n",
    "    [(\"s1\", \"a\", \"s2\"), (\"s2\", \"b\", \"s3\"), (\"s3\", \"a\", \"s3\")],\n",
    "    #Initial state\n",
    "    \"s1\",\n",
    "    #Terminal states\n",
    "    [\"s3\"]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ab_a_ = ...` assigns the result of evaluating the right hand side to the variable `ab_a_`.\n",
    "* `StateMachine(...)` creates a new object of the StateMachine class\n",
    "* `[...]` is a comma-separated list of arbitrary \"things\". This list could grow or shrink but the key idea is that its length is unknown in advance to the code that's processing it (usually necessitating some kind of iteration or recursion over the length of the list).\n",
    "* `(...)` without a word to its left is a \"tuple\", a fixed-length sequence of objects. Here, each 3-tuple defines the source state, the transition symbol, and the target state. (If there were a word to the left of the parentheses, it would be a function call as in the case of `StateMachine(...)`).\n",
    "* `\"...\"` is a \"string\", a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, the line above makes a machine with three states that accepts `aba+`, if written as a regular expression (and stores the machine into the variable `ab_a_`): any string with the prefix `ab` followed by one or more `a`. Here's `ab(cab)+d`, `ab` followed by one or more repetitions of `cab` ending with a `d`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ab_cab_d = StateMachine(\n",
    "    [(\"s1\", \"a\", \"s2\"),\n",
    "     (\"s2\", \"b\", \"s3\"), # The same so far...\n",
    "     (\"s3\", \"c\", \"s4\"),\n",
    "     (\"s4\", \"a\", \"s5\"),\n",
    "     (\"s5\", \"b\", \"s6\"),\n",
    "     (\"s6\", \"c\", \"s4\"), # Note the loop back to s4 on \"c\"\n",
    "     (\"s6\", \"d\", \"s7\")], # Or else the continuation to s7 on \"d\"\n",
    "    \"s1\",\n",
    "    [\"s7\"]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two questions of interest for any transition system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the current configuration?\n",
    "* What configurations are accessible from the current configuration, and how?\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we can use e.g. `ab_a_.state` to get its current state identifier, and `ab_a_.out_edges()` to get a Python `dict` of the successors (with `ab_a_.out_edges().keys()` yielding the symbols and the `ab_a_.out_edgdes().values()` giving the successor states).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one operation on state machines that we're interested in right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Advance the state machine along a particular available edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write e.g. `ab_a_.advance(\"a\")` to advance the `ab_a_` machine by feeding it the symbol `\"a\"`. If it starts in state `\"s1\"`, this will put it into state `\"s2\"`. Then we can call `ab_a_.advance(\"b\")` to feed it a `\"b\"` and advance it to `\"s3\"`, and so on. It is an error to call `advance` with an unavailable or invalid symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what the StateMachine class should look like, we can define it. Recall that Python is indentation-sensitive:"
