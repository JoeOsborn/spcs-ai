Make a Tracery grammar to generate some interesting artifact: Genre stories, TV episodes, SVG images, Emoji compositions, musical leitmotifs, classified ads, inspirational quotes, fantasy game items, small programs... and use it somehow, maybe in a Twitter bot (using cheapbotsdonequick) or in some other context.

Put your Tracery grammar `.json` file in here as `lastname.json`.
